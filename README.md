# Pneumothorax-Detection

A pneumothorax or collapsed lungs is a medical condition that is responsible for making the people suddenly gasp for air, and feel helplessly breathless for no apparent reason. It can be a complete lung collapse or a collapse of a portion of the lung. It is usually diagnosed by a radiologist with several years of experience on a chest x- ray; which sometimes is very difficult to confirm.
